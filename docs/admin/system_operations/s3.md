# S3-API Related Operations

## Prior Knowledge

When choosing Amazon S3 API[^1] as LeoGateway's protocol, you need LeoFS' S3-API related operations including [Endpoint](#endpoint), [User](#user), and [Bucket](#bucket) operations.


You can access a LeoFS system whose LeoGateway's protocol is S3-API by following the flow.

1. **Create an endpoint** to be able to access a LeoFS system's resources.
2. **Create a user** to separately manage the user's buckets and objects.
3. After creating a bucket, If you need to **change ACL of a bucket**, you can set it as an administrator of a LeoFS system. The current version, v1.3 of LeoFS does not support


## Operations
### Endpoint

You can continue to use a LeoFS system's DNS name to access its resources after you've set up an endpoint, which has a policy that controls the use of the endpoint to access the resources.

#### Create an endpoint, `add-endpoint`

Creates an endpoint so users can access a LeoFS system's resources.

```bash
$ leofs-adm add-endpoint <endpoint>

## Example
$ leofs-adm add-endpoint leo-project.net
OK
```

#### Remove an endpoint, `delete-endpoint`

Removes an endpoint if a LeoFS system's system does not need it.

```bash
$ leofs-adm delete-endpoint <endpoint>

## Example
$ leofs-adm delete-endpoint leo-project.net
OK
```

#### Retrieve a list of endpoints, `get-endpoints`

Retrieves a list of the endpoints if you need to know the existing endpoints.

```bash
$ leofs-adm get-endpoints

## Example
$ leofs-adm get-endpoints
endpoint         | created at
-----------------+---------------------------
leo-project.net  | 2017-04-07 10:07:31 +0900
localhost        | 2017-04-07 10:06:18 +0900
s3.amazonaws.com | 2017-04-07 10:06:18 +0900
```


### User

To access a LeoFS system, its system's users need to create an account and retrieve `AccessKeyID` and `SecretAccessKey`.

#### Create a user, `create-user`

Creates a user's account so its user can access a LeoFS system.

```bash
$ leofs-adm create-user <user-id> <password>

## Example
$ leofs-adm create-user leofs-user-1 PASSWORD
access-key-id: b5f0413d45855fcc055e
secret-access-key: b74f9ae91dd0de81f71e19f8d455a7c081f34c57
```

#### Remove a user, `delete-user`

Removes a user account if a LeoFS system does not need it.

```bash
$ leofs-adm delete-user <user-id>

## Example
$ leofs-adm delete-user leofs-user-1
OK
```

#### Retrieve a list of users, `get-users`

Retrieves a list of the users if you need to know the existing users.

```bash
$ leofs-adm get-users

## Example
$ leofs-adm get-users
user_id      | role_id | access_key_id          | created_at
-------------+---------+------------------------+---------------------------
_test_leofs  | 9       | 05236                  | 2017-04-10 09:52:39 +0900
leofs-user-2 | 1       | b5f0413d45855fcc055e   | 2017-04-10 09:54:35 +0900
```

#### Change role of a user, `update-user-role`

Updates a user's role if you need to change the role of a LeoFS system. You can choose a role from `Administrator` or `General user`.

| Role Id | Description   |
|:-------:|---------------|
| 1       | Administrator |
| 9       | General User  |

```bash
$ leofs-adm update-user-role <user-id> <role-id>

## Example
$ leofs-adm update-user-role leofs-user-2 9
OK

## Confirm the latest list of the users
$ leofs-adm get-users
user_id      | role_id | access_key_id          | created_at
-------------+---------+------------------------+---------------------------
_test_leofs  | 9       | 05236                  | 2017-04-10 09:52:39 +0900
leofs-user   | 1       | 3c1d889cdd2088fb9482   | 2017-04-10 09:53:33 +0900
leofs-user-2 | 9       | b5f0413d45855fcc055e   | 2017-04-10 09:54:35 +0900
```


### Bucket

To manage objects under a bucket, you need to create a bucket with `leofs-adm` or any client for Amazon S3 such as s3cmd[^2] and DragonDisk[^3].

#### Create a bucket, `add-bucket`

Creates a bucket so a LeoFS system' users can manage resources under its bucket.

```bash
$ leofs-adm add-bucket <bucket-name> <access-key-id>

## Example
$ leofs-adm add-bucket backup 05236
OK
```

!!! note "Note: Creating bucket with the same name as one being removed"
    It's not possible to create bucket with the same name as one currently being removed. Deletion of all objects belonging to former bucket must complete before bucket with the same name can be created again.

#### Remove a bucket, `delete-bucket`

Removes a bucket if its user does not need it. The bucket name is removed right away, while objects from that bucket will be deleted in asynchronous fashion after that.

```bash
$ leofs-adm delete-bucket <bucket-name> <access-key-id>

## Example
$ leofs-adm delete-bucket backup 05236
OK
```

!!! note "Note: How many delete-bucket requests can be proceeded at once"
    8 delete-bucket requests can be proceeded at once and if there are over 8 ones then exceeded ones are pushed on a queue and will be proceeded later once the number of processing delete-bucket go down under 8.

#### Retrieve a list of the ongoing delete-buckets, `delete-bucket-stats`

Retrieves a list of the ongoing delete-buckets if you need to know the progress of the ongoing delete-buckets.

```bash
$ leofs-adm delete-bucket-stats <bucket-name>

## Example
$ leofs-adm delete-bucket-stats
- Bucket: test_2
node                         | state            | date
-----------------------------+------------------+-----------------------------
storage_3@127.0.0.1          | pending          | 2017-07-27 09:20:47 +0900
storage_2@127.0.0.1          | monitoring       | 2017-07-27 09:21:21 +0900
storage_1@127.0.0.1          | monitoring       | 2017-07-27 09:21:21 +0900
storage_0@127.0.0.1          | monitoring       | 2017-07-27 09:21:22 +0900

- Bucket: test_4
node                         | state            | date
-----------------------------+------------------+-----------------------------
storage_3@127.0.0.1          | finished         | 2017-07-27 09:21:20 +0900
storage_2@127.0.0.1          | finished         | 2017-07-27 09:21:18 +0900
storage_1@127.0.0.1          | finished         | 2017-07-27 09:21:21 +0900
storage_0@127.0.0.1          | monitoring       | 2017-07-27 09:21:10 +0900

## Example (No ongoing delete-buckets)
$ leofs-adm delete-bucket-stats
[ERROR] Delete-bucket's stats not found
```

The below table explains what each state means.

| State      | Description                                                                                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| pending    | Waiting on the queue.                                                                                        |
| enqueuing  | Iterating all objects and enqueuing object identifiers into the queue if those belong to the bucket deleted. |
| monitoring | Iterating all items in the queue and deleting objects one by one.                                            |
| finished   | Finished delete-bucket and waiting for other storage nodes.                                                  |

!!! note "Note: How long the delete-bucket records exist"
    Once the state of every storage node transit into finished, the delete-bucket records get deleted within several tens of seconds.

#### Reset a delete-bucket-stats record, `reset-delete-bucket-stats`

Reset a delete-bucket-stats record if you face some trouble that inconsistency between manager nodes and storage nodes happened and only way to solve this problem is to reset(delete) a delete-bucket-stats record.

```bash
$ leofs-adm reset-delete-bucket-stats <bucket-name>

## Example
$ leofs-adm reset-delete-bucket-stats bucket
OK
```

!!! note "Note: Removing inaccessible objects after `reset-delete-bucket-stats`"
    Since this operation aborts deletion of objects belonging to (already deleted) bucket, it might be a good idea to create and delete bucket with same name again after `reset-delete-bucket-stats`, to make sure that bucket deletion completes properly and no stale objects remain. 

#### Retrieve a list of buckets, `get-buckets`

Retrieves a list of the buckets if you need to know the existing buckets.

```bash
$ leofs-adm get-buckets

## Example
$ leofs-adm get-buckets
cluster id   | bucket   | owner       | permissions      | redundancy method            | created at
-------------+----------+-------------+------------------+------------------------------+---------------------------
leofs_1      | test     | _test_leofs | Me(full_control) | copy, {n:1, w:1, r:1, d:1}   | 2017-04-10 10:57:29 +0900

```

#### Retrieve a bucket, `get-bucket`

Retrieves a bucket if you need to know its bucket's information.

```bash
$ leofs-adm get-bucket <access-key-id>

## Example
$ leofs-adm get-bucket 05236
bucket   | permissions                            | created at
---------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------
backup   | Me(full_control), Everyone(read)       | 2017-04-10 10:39:01 +0900
docs     | Me(full_control), Everyone(read)       | 2017-04-10 10:39:25 +0900
logs     | Me(full_control), Everyone(read,write) | 2017-04-10 10:39:38 +0900
movie    | Me(full_control)                       | 2017-04-10 10:39:45 +0900
```

#### Change an owner of a bucket, `chown-bucket`

Updates an owner of a bucket if you need to change its owner to someone else.

```bash
$ leofs-adm chown-bucket <bucket> <access-key-id>

## Example
$ leofs-adm chown-bucket test b5f0413d45855fcc055e
OK

## Confirm the latest list of the buckets
$ leofs-adm get-buckets
cluster id   | bucket   | owner        | permissions      | redundancy method            | created at
-------------+----------+--------------+------------------+------------------------------+---------------------------
leofs_1      | test     | leofs-user-2 | Me(full_control) | copy, {n:1, w:1, r:1, d:1}   | 2017-04-10 10:57:29 +0900
```

#### Update ACL of a bucket, `update-acl`

Updates ACL of a bucket if you need to change it.

```bash
$ leofs-adm update-acl <bucket> <access-key-id> <canned-ACL>

## Example
$ leofs-adm update-acl test 05236 private
ok
$ leofs-adm update-acl test 05236 public-read
ok
$ leofs-adm update-acl test 05236 public-read-write
ok
```

##### Canned ACL

When using S3-API, LeoFS supports a set of predefined grants, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined a set of grantees and permissions. The following table lists the set of canned ACLs and the associated predefined grants.

| Canned ACL         | Applies To        | Permissions Added To ACL |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| private            | Bucket and object | `[default]` Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. No one else has access rights.|
| public-read        | Bucket and object | Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ access.|
| public-read-write  | Bucket and object | Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ and WRITE access. Granting this on a bucket is generally not recommended.|
